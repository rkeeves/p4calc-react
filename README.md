## Overview

Patrician IV is a medieval trading game.

It is - partly - an economy simulation, with weird rules and somewhat complex state. Due to this it can be a bit of a bother to tell your profits, etc.

Although the rules are weird and complex, the system is deterministic, and can be computed. So one can make a calculator for it.
